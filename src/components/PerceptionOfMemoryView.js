                           Today’s a full moon.
That’s the first thing you notice as your eyes flutter awake and roam to the open window right in front of them. The plain ivory curtains made to match the carpet, are flitting away slightly, so it must be windy, but you can’t feel it.
                           </p>
                           <p> Itchy-itch, something’s crawling on your leg.
3:06 am, that’s what the digital clock besides your bed says, and that’s when you finally decide to leave its slightly-icky abode.</p>
                           <p>
                           Five steps northwest to the calendar hanging on the wall, you cross out today. Fifth day this week that sleep betrayed you in the middle. Two steps from there towards an ephemeral glance at the world outside through the window. The mortal being of partial death spreads her cloak over every one, indiscriminately. But it’s us few fortunate ones who escape slyly through the tiny holes in its fabric.
                           </p>
                           <p>The city sleeps. It’s a harmless silent outlook but you pay no heed to it. You’re focusing on something else. There’s a dull dryness at the back of your throat, so you decide to force it down with water. Water. A tingling runs down your arm, a creepy sensation. Five steps to reach the door, and a turn left. Six, seven, eight,.. Fifteen steps in the dark and you lightly brush past the hanging pillar, assuring you you’re in the kitchen. Twenty one steps and you open the refrigerator to get a drink. Overlooking the giant freezing appliance, hangs a painting. You gaze at it for the umpteenth time as you gulp down water from a petite glass.</p>
                           <p> Hard objects become limp in this bleak landscape, while metal attracts ants like rotting flesh. Watches melt into oblivion, and time was never relevant. This inaudibly descriptive landscape of a dense premise but a rather soft overtone, hints at the absence of the space-time warp. Mortal decay and irrational dreams. Rock-bottom flotations and healthy delusions. Pretty picture but a puzzling outlook.</p>
                           <p> The aching sting reaches the throat.
                                Water rather than extinguishing, seems to instigate it, like fire to existing fire. The glass drops, but there’s no shatter. The scenery in front of you inverts. The ceiling is on the ground, or is it you that’s defied gravity? Chairs float and so do books and shoes, but the painting stays stable. Etched in the back of your head, you can see it clear as ever.</p>
                           <p>  Until you can’t.
The risen itch, now a strong burning pain in your eye is the last thing you remember as you lose consciousness and reality loses you.</p>
                           <p> You’re now sitting at a train station. It’s lively, perfect weather. It’s sunny but somehow, cold. The bench you’re sitting on is rusty and makes a creaking sound every time you shift your position but you pay no heed to it. You’re focusing on something else. People in heavy long coats carrying bulky briefcases swiftly walk past you, but your gaze does not deter from the train tracks in front of you. A flash of light. The train is coming. Someone bumped into you hard, prompting you to lose the ground for a second or two.</p> 
                           <p> You glance to find the culprit, but there’s no one around you. The station is empty, lifeless. No one was ever there, it seems.
The train whizzes past you and blares deafeningly. Crash! The excruciatingly loud sound is painful. The train has long passed ahead but you pay no heed to it. You’re focusing on something else. You cover your ears but the awful screeching doesn’t seem to muffle.</p> 
                           <p> Almost feels like it’s coming from within you. Oh god, it’s so awful. And repulsive. Like a crow crying and shrieking.
You crouch down to the ground, blocking your ears and forcing your eyes shut. You’re breathing hard and you’re not breathing at all. The ground feels soft. After a painful eternity, the crow ceases its bellowing. You open your eyes to see you’re standing in a pasture, a wide green belt extending from and to infinitude. It’s warm but there’s no sun. The sky is clear but there’s no sun. The day is bright, but there is no sun.</p> 
                           <p>The crow is perching on the patch of grass right in front of you. It’s staring at you. Oh god, it’s so black. It’s so dark, you feel like you’re staring into a deep trench, a pitch black cavity of emptiness. It will give you nothing, for it is nothing, except nihility and atrocity. You reach out to touch it, you have to. To check if it’s there. To check if you’re there.</p>
                           <p>You tread along on this lush path. It’s a quiet walk, seemingly contrary to the fiery ball of anguish that you call your heart. Things have been weird lately, and you have been looking for answers. How characteristic!</p> 
                           <p>You want an explanation to the quick paradigm shift that has been changing your surroundings unreasonably, but you sideline those feelings for the time being. You wish for it, but you pay no heed to it. You’re focusing on something else. It’s the calm, solitary walk. Approaching nothingness, your bare-feet betray your brainy intentions to follow the path of your heart. The heart and the mind, the naughty pair, these two never seem to agree upon anything! The fruit-less long walk is arduous but assuring.
Until it’s not.</p> 
                           <p>The serenity flashes out faster than it came in. The green dissolves to an achromatic surface. Unusually cold, you like it. A blank static, that’s your TV in front of you.</p>
                           <p> In a haze, you look around and recognize your living room. Indeed the beige sofa you’re sitting on, the gracefully arrogant artifacts lying around, the ivory carpet, the tasteless walls they indicate it all; it is your home. It is late, you realize and head for bed. Seven steps and you walk past the painting, but you pay no heed to it. You’re focusing on something else. A perfect blank. Twenty more counted steps and you reach your deserted room.</p> 
                           <p> You lie down and try to slip off into wonderland, because that’s all what we yearn for in the end. Ease, comfort and partial conscience. Mother sleep is despised by the determined and idolized by the indolent. But we can’t stay split from her for long. She is tender, forbearing and merciful.</p> 
                           <p> Until she is not. She is just an accomplice to her elder sister, and you just gave in to the temptation. </p>
